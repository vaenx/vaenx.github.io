        <h2><a class="ex3" href="https://pipedrive.com/">Pipedrive</a> is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software that enables
          salespeople to better organize their time, so they can focus on what really matters. As in other CRMs across the SaaS world, the
        automation of more manual and repetitive processes is a needed feature that highlights even more their core values of time saving
      and focus enabling. Whereas the automation of workflows might be tricky to learn or even scary to practice — you are indeed going
    to trust a machine to send an email on your behalf — this project was focused on simplifying the creation of workflows, demistifying the
    <i>bot factor</i> and making people trust, and ultimately use, the feature more.</h2>

I worked together with the researcher and the PM to define flows, sketch early mockups and interview users. I prototyped solutions and performed usability tests with internal and external users and had the development team involved throughout the whole design process, which was key in having their feedback and contribution as early as possible, as well as an edge on the development process.</h2>

                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <h2>Workflow automation allows users to build sequences to perform repetitive tasks which are part of their usual workflows. It is a complex feature that, when correctly used, can help users save time and focus on closing deals. Despite its potential benefits, the fear of doing something wrong when setting up automated workflows pushed users to do one of two things: (1) visit the feature and never go back; and (2) set up an automated workflow without actually running/activating it. Our goal was thus to empower the user in building workflows, removing the friction of setting up a complicated workflow structure, while promoting trust in the automated sequence created, hence contributing to the user’s autonomy in using the feature.</h2>

              <div class="proj_detail_content detail_content_center">
                <h5>Results</h5>
                <h2>With the implementation of Workflow Automation templates feature usage increased by ~30% in the first three months. We reached some important findings along the way such as improving Workflow Automation’s discoverability; making the automation canvas a more intuitive solution; as well as take power users’ needs of tailoring into consideration.</h2>

                  <h2>As a result of the Design Sprint our solution focused on providing a template list that would target common use cases. A specific action could then be the trigger to some of the most perfomed use cases in Pipedrive:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><h2>Add an activity</h2></li>

                  <li><h2>Move a deal to a specific stage</h2></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>To help the user set up the template quickly and with the least friction, we focused on having a wizard mapping the way. By dividing mandatory data input by sections we allowed the user to focus on a section at a time, avoiding overwhelming situations. By doing this we were pushing the user forward, giving back small hints that we was doing the right thing.</h2>

                <h2>Another need we were trying to cover was to start getting the user familiar with the canvas view, where the workflow structure would appear. In order to achieve this we added to the wizard a map of the workflow skeleton, as a preview. During testing we found out the additional information was actually adding an extra layer of complexity which was just confusing people.</h2>
                <h2>We tried to provide the user with a different set of categories in the sidebar, specifically targetting common salesperson’s goals, instead of general actions to guide the user in discovering the most adequate template for a specific need. From Pipeline management and Lead nurturing through to Admin processes, that change only made the whole categorization unclear and proved that sticking to the simple actions was a better solution. We opted to focus on the action being taken.</h2>

                <h2>Interestingly, even if users did understand that automation would help them focus on their business, save time and ultimately money, templates alone were not helping users understand how they could incorporate them into their own processes and existing workflows. This was a matter out of the scope of this project, but we considered important to provide as much as a quick introduction to it. In order to do that we added a “Get started” category, in which users would be presented with specific use cases that could inspire some of their own.</h2>

                  <li><h2>Add an Automation course module to Pipedrive’s Academy course list, so users can be even more confident about how the feature might work and impact their personal workflows.</h2></li>
                  <li><h2>Improve filtering in the Pipeline view to allow users to clearly understand that adding filters to a specific view will enable more actions in the automation workflows.</h2></li>
                  <li><h2>Potentially add an option to run tests to a specific worfklow.</h2></li>

                the immediate readability of the workflow alone and the filtration through a sidebar — there was an evolution towards a more visually
                appealing solution, mainly to make it as friendly as possible and hopefully bring back the customers that the automation feature was scaring away.</h2>
                <h2>The workflow creation wizard was a challenge in itself. We did want to both introduce the concept of triggers, actions and conditions to
                users who are less familiar with using the <i>canvas</i>, as well as to help map the idea of consequence and timeline at the same time.
                Finally we decided to focus on the idea of a unique timeline and ditched the skeleton of the canvas next to the blocks of triggers and actions,
                since after testing with users it proved to be mostly a distraction rather than an added value to explain the process.</h2>

                  process, turning the whole <i>automatic</i> aura of the feature, at the same time that it stressed the time people would be saving by
