        <h2><a class="ex3" href="https://pipedrive.com/">Pipedrive</a> is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software that enables
          salespeople to better organize their time, so they can focus on what really matters. As in other CRMs across the SaaS world, the
        automation of more manual and repetitive processes is a needed feature that highlights even more their core values of time saving
      and focus enabling. Whereas the automation of workflows might be tricky to learn or even scary to practice — you are indeed going
    to trust a machine to send an email on your behalf — this project was focused on simplifying the creation of workflows, demistifying the
    <i>bot factor</i> and making people trust, and ultimately use, the feature more.</h2>

            <h2>To address this issue we started by scheduling a 5-day design sprint based on Google Venture's book by Jake Knapp,
              entitled <a class="ex3" href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/"><i>Sprint</i></a>.
            We gathered a small group of 3 developers, 2 designers, 1 researcher and 1 product manager and occasionally invited sales representatives.</h2>

          <div class="proj_detail_content detail_content_center">
            <h5>Day 1</h5>
            <h2>We kicked the week off with an overview of what we want to achieve each day. It is crucial that we keep the plan by the end of each day,
            because our end-goal is to test a working prototype on Friday to collect feedback and start a
            <a class="ex3" href="https://medium.com/pipedrive-developers/scaling-pipedrive-engineering-from-teams-to-tribes-8f14fd92df8c">mission</a>
            as soon as possible. The plan is to write down our assumptions regarding Workflow Automation and define our long-term goal, after which we add
            our <i>How Might We</i> notes to the wall so we can actually define the end target we are going to focus on.
            Oh and at the same time a few interviews are being done by our amazing researcher, so we have our personas ready to help keep us on track.</h2>

            and Sharpies and put our ideas in gallery view to later explain them to everyone and start the voting process on the ones we thought
            might be the most valuable. This is particularly useful to have uncommon thoughts see the light of day and influence the
            duller ones. Then the hard part begins, when we hit the board to try to make use of what our lovely minds came up with, trying to answer
            the problem we identified the day before, in the specific parts that were mapped as those that needed more attention.</h2>

            the day has finally come to put them into a hi-fi prototype (as much as possible). While designers were mainly busy with putting the
            prototype together, the rest was busy working on a script and preparing the usability testing for the next day.</h2>
            <h2>We focused mainly on (1) providing pre-made templates for the most used automations within Pipedrive, which would consequently
            jumpstart the use of a <i>hard to learn</i> feature (based on the result of client surveys);
            (2) we focused also on building a workflow creation wizard, which purpose would be to guide the user along the way and allow for a reduced
            amount of customization as well as to make each step of the way as transparent as possible, to increase trust.</h2>

            understand if we are on the right track and answer questions like: <i>will our users value templates?</i> or <i>will template usage trigger
            the usage of automation as a feature?</i>. So it's time to take notes, ask questions and analyse the results of our design sprint week.
            Are we ready to use what we have come up with as the basis of our next mission?</h2>

            <h2>The basic and first prototype we came up with during the design sprint along with the results and findings we gathered from
            testing it on friday, will lead the way into the Mission ahead. Changes are incorporated and for the next 2 months the focus will
            be on building a consistent solution and have it tested internally and externally to make sure the changes made are what we
            are looking for.</h2>
            <h2>Our initial prototype had some problems that we immediately identified during user testing, but it was useful to make sure we would
            definitely explore templates and the use of a creation wizard. On the down side? We had a lot to improve regarding onboarding
            and preparation to land in the unruly area of <i>the canvas</i>.</h2>
            <h2>Templates should make users' life easier by allowing to pick a premade workflow, but on version 1 it wasn't completely clear what
            would trigger the actions and what they would actually be. Also, the idea of making it more transparent and user friendly wasn't quite
            coming along from there. Along the way we decided to illustrate what the templates would do, which proved much better in terms of
            both user understanding and engagement.</h2>
