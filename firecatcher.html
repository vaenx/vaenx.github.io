        <h2>Firecatcher is a concept designed for the need to help fight the tragedy that wildfires have become.
        In Portugal as around the world, the calls for help multiply and are often left unheard, for multiple reasons.
        Firecatcher aims at helping populations team up and better communicate to provide the precious help firefighters may need.</h2>

            <h6>About</h6>
            <h2>Wildfires have been a constant and growing worry in the near past in many areas of the globe.
                Portugal has been one of the affected countries with some tragic events left behind, where communication was affected
                and where population voluntarily joined forces to help.</h2>
            <h6>The Problem</h6>
            <h2>Communication and overall organisation lacked the necessary structure to quickly act and put together an action plan
              for those willing to help. Tech-savvy people would use Facebook and Instagram to share the calls for help through hashtags
              and gather goods and other needed supplies, without having a full overview of how much help they would get.</h2>
            <h6>Solution</h6>
            <h2>Firecatcher is both a real-time wildfire meter and a team-organisation tool, for an easy task distribution and orientation
              among locals who don’t know each other but could use nearby help, using gamification as a trigger.</h2>

            <h6>Generative Research</h6>
            <h2>Curiously, people — specifically younger and more tech oriented people — focused on Facebook or Instagram to quickly
              share how they were planning to help the affected ones, where to meet and what to do.
              Interestingly, some were even relying on Uber services to transport goods to the affected locations and Firefighters.
              So, how do we get people to quickly organise in teams and provide help in whatever way they can to affected communities,
              considering the delays there may be in communication and the difficulties associated with it?</h2>
